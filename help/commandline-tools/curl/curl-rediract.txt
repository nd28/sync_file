Can I download from Git Repository Release section using the tool "curl"?
If Yes then, How?

Somebody from stackoverflow.com said that,
"If you want to use curl you have to use redirect option 
 to follow the redirect link and direct the output in a
 file like this:
 `curl -L {url_to_package} > {package_name_with_ext}`
--Let's try this out.
`curl -L https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.1.0/Hasklig.zip > NF-Hasklig-v2.1.zip`
Because I want to download hasklig fonts whitch is fork of source code pro with ligatures.
